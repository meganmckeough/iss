# Where [over] the world is the ISS?

## A project to track the ISS, practise React, and have fun with APIs.

Try it and track the ISS now!

### What is it?

A place where you can see what the ISS is up to! It orbits the Earth once every 90 minutes or so.

You can track where the ISS is located (lat and lon); which country it is over right now; and that country's flag. 

You can also see when it will next be over your exact location, and who is aboard the ISS currently.

### How does it work?

This was built with React.js, and using [Open Notify](http://open-notify.org/), [GeoNames](http://www.geonames.org/), and [CountryFlags.io](https://countryflags.io/) APIs. Fuelled by a love of space and a desire to learn.

### Additions

Next version to include a search (when will the ISS be over a specific country?).
